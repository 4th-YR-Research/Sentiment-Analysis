I sent them over. They said they would review them within 24 hours. In reality, it's been a week, and no one can help or give any (truthful) estimate of when it will be resolved; they just tell me to 'wait.' I've never seen such a horrible marketplace in my life. I hope those who came up with this can't buy food in a store, receiving a 'document review request' that takes forever to process.",2024-09-16

I pointed out I can’t receive texts EITHER!!They said parcel was on its way so couldn’t stop it. I pointed out I WOULD NOT WANT IT as, I had PERMANENTLY CLOSED my account!The driver came whilst I was out and failed to even follow my settings info that said to deliver to a specific neighbour if I was out, since then my account has now been deleted",2024-09-16
Greg Dunn,/users/62c35cdbacc0ea0012ccaffa,AU,5 reviews,2024-09-17 07:15:49+00:00,1.0,Advertise one price then increase it on website,I have bought from Amazon before and no problems being very happy with the service and price. Amazon advertise the product at 61.23 us as soon as I logged in and tried to buy two of the items they were 86.75 for each.There is no way of contacting customer service I've spent an hour going round and round in circles. Very disappointing. I would leave a negative star review for the customer service and what I consider to be really poor advertising. ,2024-09-17
Sheila Hannah,/users/5ddbe429478d88251550610e,GB,8 reviews,2024-09-16 18:37:17+00:00,1.0,If I could give a lower rate I would,If I could give a lower rate I would! I cancelled my Amazon Prime in February and subsequently found that they had continued to charge me. When I contacted them they refused to give details of who had set up the payment as I didn't have Prime membership at that time. My credit card company cancelled the payment for me and refunded the payments made in June. I have just discovered that Amazon Prime has set up payments again without me being a Prime member!! I have had to cancel my credit card to stop them!!Do not trust Amazon Prime. ,2024-09-16
